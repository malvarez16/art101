  <h1>May's Art 101 Index</h1>
  <h2>Introduction </h2>
  <p> My name is May Alvarez, and I use (she/her) pronouns. I am in my fourth
    year at UCSC, studying Film and Digital Media and Art. I am interested in
    animation, and hope to pursue a career in the animation industry. I eventually
    want to go into storyboarding, and work at a major animation studio. <br>
     In my free time, I like to paint, and go on walks. I also like to bake cookies
    for my housemates. I've taken up reading outside of school assignments. I am
    currently reading Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell. I highly recommend.
