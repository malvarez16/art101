    	<h3>Challenges</h3>
    	<p>One of my challeges was finding a partner. Thankfully one of my past partners
      was willing to allow me to hop on the lab with the partner she had already. We
      used Discord to communicate, which I don't use often, but we managed to make it work.</p>
    	<h3>Problems</h3>
    		<p>I had some problems with labeling my objects and labelling my arrays when I first started.
      I kept getting the two confused and trying to use referencing for arrays on the object. This
      obviously didn't give me the results I wanted, so I went back and found my mix-up.</p>
    	<h3>Results</h3>
    		<p>This is my outcome. I definitely was very intimidated starting off this lab,
      but I managed to troubleshoot my problems and solve them on my own. Nothing unmanageable. </p>
