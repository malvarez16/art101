		<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
		<h2> Purpose </h2>
			<p> The purpose of this lab was to set up and organize a well-made file structure.
				This will make things easier code as we continue.  </p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2
			<p> Overall, we didn't face too many challenges. It felt pretty straighforward
				for a lab. There were some tweaks we had to make of simple mistakes in the HTML, but
        other than that it wasn't too difficult. We think that this lab will help set us up
        for Lab 4.
		<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> Now we have nicely organized files so that the coding process can be smoother
				moving forward. This is what my file structure looks like.</p>
