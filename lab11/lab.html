        <h3>Challenges</h3>
          I found this lab to be a lot more challenging because I wasn't able to attend section on Wednesday and Monday was a holiday.

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        I couldn't get my button to output the images that I had linked. I want to ask Brock about it.

    <div id="results">
        <h3>Results</h3>
      It's not the most exciting page yet, but hopefully it'll look better once I figure out how to add the pictures.
