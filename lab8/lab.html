      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      I don't see any big challenges so far.
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      For some reason, when I would paste something into Atom it would turn the
      whole page gray. I quickly learned how to resolve this problem after a little
      Googling
      <h3>Results</h3>
      I think Atom was confused when pasting an outside source, so I had to adjust
      the settings to ensure it recognized the code as HTML.
