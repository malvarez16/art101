      <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>I never was a huge fan of Harry Potter growing up. I didn't really want to make my Conditionals
        based on a series that I never resonated with. Not to mention, J.K. Rowling has said a lot of transphobic comments
        that I do not stand by. I don't want to take the magic away from anyone, but I think it's important we stay mindful
        of who we support in this world.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p> I chose to make my Conidtionals example based on a series I did enjoy growing up. Therefore you will be accepted
          into the world of Demigods. I'm so sorry you had to find out this way. Your parents have some explaining to do.
