      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p> JSON really intimidates me, so I found the lab to be quite challending. Petr was a great partner to have
        since they were more knowledgable than me on the subject. </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p> After several attempts I managed to get the comic to appear. Check it out by  clicking
        the button. <button id="button">Click for a comic!</button></a></p>
