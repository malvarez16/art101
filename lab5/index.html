	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	There were some challenges with this lab. My partner had small syntax errors, so
	her Javascipt code didn't work, and there were no outputs.
	After reviewing her code, I couldn't quite find her error. I used my own JS code
	to compare the two. Eventually, we caught the error. It was just frustruting to
	try to find.

	<h3>Problems</h3>
	I had WIFI problems because of the rain storm, so it was a bit hard to finish this lab.
	I relied heavily on my hotspot.
	<h3>Results</h3>
	It was very satisying to have both my and my partner's sitess working. It was an important lesson
	to remind ourselves to constantly check out coding as we go, because the smallest
	mistake can mess up the whole output.
